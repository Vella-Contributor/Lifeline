The ultimate 24*7  hospital app which tracks the availability of a doctor in the hospitals nearby your location. 

Todays scenario is like if an accident happens he/she is taken to the nearby hospital without knowing whether a doctor is persent their to treat the victim. <br> <br>

Therefore,with this application we are solving this issue by keeping a track of real time location of doctors visible on the user interaface so that if any mishappen takes place , he/she could be taken to the right hospital at right time.



<u> How it works : </u>
As soon as doctor arrives hospital he is automatically made dicover-able with his location on user interface , in which details reagarding doctors are shown to the client and vice-versa.

<b> <u> User Interface </u> </b> 

It shows real time location of doctors currently active (present inside hospitals) in your location. <br>
 Information includes : 

<ul>
<li> Expertise of doctor </li>
<li> Distance from your location </li>
<li> Optimum time </li>
<li> Speciality of doctor </li>
</ul>


Finally we can have shortest path route via google maps.

<b> <u> Doctor Interface </u> </b> 

Currnetly there are two manual buttons via which we can control whether doctor is availaible or not and the same is reflected on the user interface.
